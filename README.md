# Fusion

(Note: This repository is not used for in-development versions, they are on a private gitlab to keep them very much seperate. Because if they aren't seperate I'll forget and then I'll modify the wrong one.)

## Introduction

Hello, welcome to Fusion.

Fusion is a work-in-progress command line text and code editor written in python and based off of the curses module.

This repository currently only exists to claim the name Fusion for the editor.

## The Idea

The idea behind Fusion is that most CLI text editors are packaged as binaries, but what if you want to use your favourite editor on a device where you can't install or run binaries!

In these situations, it would be amazing to have an editor you can customise to your heart's content while never needing to run a binary, and that's where Fusion comes in!
